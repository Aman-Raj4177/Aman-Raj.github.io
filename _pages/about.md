I am currently a PhD student in the Circular Economy and Sustainable Energy and Materials (CESEM) Lab at Arizona State University (ASU), working under the guidance of [Dr. Dwarak Ravikumar](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1869256). I earned my MSc in Sustainable Systems from the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at Rochester Institute of Technology, where I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Callie Babbitt](https://www.rit.edu/directory/cwbgis-callie-babbitt) and [Dr. Nenad Nenadic](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gOd2RFIAAAAJ&hl=en). My graduate project explored the life cycle impacts of the remanufacturing process for reusing lithium-ion battery (LIB) packs in second-life battery applications, contributing to emerging knowledge on battery circularity and reuse pathways.

At ASU, my current research focuses on end-of-life (EoL) waste management strategies for clean energy technologies, with particular attention to solar photovoltaic (PV) modules

Fun Fact: I also have a second Master in Public Policy from [Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai](https://tiss.ac.in/) where my graduate thesis was on " A Case Study of litchi Food Scare in Bihar from Risk Governance Perspective" under the supervision of [Dr. Chandrashekhar Joglekar](https://tiss.ac.in/view/9/employee/chandrashekhar-joglekar/)
